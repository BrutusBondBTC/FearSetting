# FearSetting
A letter written in resonse to nostr note: note1pwx0uts9ndwngm90j9zd6k7d04qz32aplhp4fztz4m008txtlgssj3ry0l

I got my degree in creative writing, but this is the part they don't teach you. I could write a novel about how I avoid fear of judgement, but that novel could be summed up in one word: Procrastination. 

I read The War of Art.

Pressfield calls this resistance.

I read Bukowski

**I still suffer from resistance**. 

For example, I want to create content using the V4V model. 

## My V4V Video Idea

I want to create a DIY multi sig tutorial, but instead of putting it behind a paywall and charging for the service, I just want to put it out there on several platforms like Youtube, Peer Tube, even BitTorrent.  Basically, I want to do the 10X Your BTC Security Guide from start to finish, even covering some of the advanced topics like how to take a hard drive and wifi card out of a laptop.

Then I just ask people for value in return. I thought about doing something like this in 2019, when I first tried out yalls.org, but it was too early. Now that I've studied how Adam Curry uses this in a non-bitcoin podcast, I want to give it a shot.

That way, I don't have to bite my tongue about something I may not like in a hardware wallet. 

I also have my own bias. I like the Cold Card, but I want to give people a chance to disagree with me so I also started copying my blog on github. Ideally, KyleOf TheCorn would write an excellent essay saying why you should use SeedSigner instead of the Cold Card. NVK could write a counter argument as to why his 2 secure elements are better.** That's why we need the freedom of speech,** by the way. We need the ability to have open discussion, to define the best security practices, to send money on an insecure communications channel over the Internet--We must evade censorship. Governments get hacked. Central Banks get hacked. We can't expect them to protect us and they give us little reason to think they can, but I digress...

### What Have You Been Putting Off The Longest?

**When I find my self putting something off for a long time, I do a fear setting exercise I got from [Tim Ferriss's Ted Talk](https://youtu.be/5J6jAC6XxAI)

I saw this post last night and became inspired to do one of these exercises for the multi sig guide, since I've been putting this off for so long.

"Online creators: How do you overcome the **fear of judgement**? It’s easy to say not to care but in truth, I feel like negativity would hurt my feelings. I’m confident, but sensitive. I need to overcome this. Any sound advice?"

See, I thought I was procrastinating because I didn't know enough. 

* I need to code better. 
* KdenLive makes me feel like a boomer setting up a new printer.
* I have to learn how to to SHA256 by hand before I can make this video
* I should don't have a degree in cryptography or computer science.

Nah. 

It's just:

**Fear**.
**Resistance**.
**And**
**Doubt**

I don't want to sound like one of those Tony Robbins infomercials so I won't use an acronym, but it's true.

Anyway, after reading your note(I'm not even sure if that's what it's called yet) I did one of those fear setting exercises for making this multisig video. 

Here's what I came up with.

# Define Prevent Repair

One of those fears on the list is "What if I sound awful?" 

Kids made fun of my voice in middle school.

In the seventh grade, I told a girl I liked her.  She mocked my voice. I was devastated.


When I numbered my items from 1-10(10 being the worst case scenario) I marked the voice thing down as a 2, but what are the odds?  There's a high likelihood of somebody saying mean shit to me on YouTube. I can almost guarantee it.  Does that let them spend my bitcoin?  NO. So it's not that big  a deal.

What if some dumb ass on YouTube did make fun of my voice? It would bother me a little, but so what? I'm happily married now and I don't even put my face or personal phone number in any of my social media accounts. 

But what if somebody loses their stack because he or she draws  seed words from a hat and it turns out this did not provide sufficient entropy.  

What if some super-hacker breaks into their house Mission Impossible Style, sprinkles special seed seeking powder to obtain key?  That's the 10--worst case scenario. What are the odds of that happening?  If I had to guess I would say you should be more worried about getting struck by lightning on your way to cash in your winning PowerBall ticket. 

Then I wrote down the things I think might go right.

My favorite is what if a widow can recover bitcoin after watching my videos?

### What Are The Consequences of Inaction?

I'm sure you're familiar with the Ghost of Christmas Past. 

Everybody procrastinates  at some point in time. 

Everyone is afraid of something.

Maybe I will fail.

Maybe I suck.

Maybe my voice has an autistic tone to it,.

When your fear of regret becomes greater than your fear of judgement, you will be compelled to create.
